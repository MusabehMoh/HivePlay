## 🚀 **Deployment Commands**

### **Local Development**
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start Redis
docker run -d -p 6379:6379 redis:alpine

# Start development server
npm run dev
```

### **Docker Production**
```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
```

### **Git Deployment**
```bash
# Add all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "feat: Add search suggestions with thumbnails and complete Docker setup"

# Push to main branch
git push origin main
```

## 📊 **Performance Metrics**

### **Target Performance**
- [ ] Docker build time < 5 minutes
- [ ] Application startup < 10 seconds
- [ ] Search suggestions < 500ms
- [ ] Audio cache hit ratio > 80%
- [ ] Page load time < 2 seconds

### **Resource Requirements**
- **RAM**: 512MB minimum, 1GB recommended
